# Bugs

# Compatibility
* MEDIUM: Improve degradation of lack of AudioContext
* MEDIUM: Improve degradation when lack of source maps for errors
* MEDIUM: Use another toolchain for SCSS minification to support other color formats.
* LOW: Phase out css vars for really old browsers.
* LOW: Re-encode videos for browsers with lack of support for certain formats.
  Certain browsers support only mp4(h264/aac) in 1920x1080 for example. Maybe streaming api?
  Maybe offer the option to re-encode the video if it doesn't load?

* Features
* LOW: Show in About support for platform APIs (Audio, Fullscreen, MediaSession, etc.)
* LOW: Allow Fullscreen to be used even if the API is not available. Maybe maximize the content in
  the desktop?
* LOW: Have a Toast ui element that can popup information inside windows. This could be useful to
  emit warnings.

# Improvements
* LOW: Refactor context menus for traditional Menus. This could allows shared code between context
  menus and menu bars.
* LOW: Disable loading of Hammer module if gestures are disabled
